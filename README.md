# Legend of Solgard Creature Translations

https://translations.denzik.io/

Legend of Solgard is a game played globally around the world. Many players connect and discuss the game in numerous languages. In an effort to help players engage and connect more easily I built this simple site to translate the game's creatures into the various languages supported by the game.

### Humble Origins

Originally built as a public Google Spreadsheet back in 2019, I decided my **[Creature Translator](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/198QUkDovto7trPWDig4JLszxeoosxTAcJwIFL4mFtiM/edit#gid=666953004)** needed a makeover.

While doing some Learning centralized around React Applications, I decided to put some of the skills learned into practice and build out a more modern web application. This application was built in collaboration with the Game Developer "Snowprint Studios". It is a simple React Application that allows for basic filtering and sorting on the data.
